#Problem 2
#Using a while loop, create a list called L that contains the numbers 0 to 10. On each
#iteration, the loop should append the current value of a counter variable to the list and then
#increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than
#10.

L = []
i = 0

while i <= 10:
    L.append(i)
    i += 1

print(L)
