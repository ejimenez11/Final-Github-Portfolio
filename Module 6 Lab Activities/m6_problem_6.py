# Problem 6: Write a program that takes a number from a user and calculates the factorial of that number in two ways:
# 1) Using a for loop to calculate the factorial of a user input value.
# 2) Using the math module. Youâ€™ll need to do some research to find the function you need.

a = int(input("Input a number for a:\n"))
b = int(input("Input a number for b:\n"))

c = math.sqrt(a ** 2) + (b ** 2)

print("\n", c)
